  <h1>HOW DO I USE THIS?</h1>

  <p>Autograph provides a simple way to find best deals for used cars on Ebay.</p>


    <p>How to interpret:</p>

    <p>Any dot below the curve is a “below” market priced vehicle for its given mileage. The further down the distance from the curve the better deal you are looking at, however, deeper investigation into “why” that car is priced that way is warranted to understand if you are actually getting a good deal or a lemon.</p>


    <p>The graph on our main page charts all available used car deals specified in the search terms and plots them depending on listing’s price and mileage. Pricing of used cars primarily depends on the brand and the mileage of the car, thus plotting all the cars of the same brand but at different points of their life allows us to derive a market pricing curve for the searched model within specified geographical area.
